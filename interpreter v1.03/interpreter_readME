#### This is a working model - there is no View or Controller at this stage
#### It has been tested with three classes, correct PlantUML
#### It will read a file, but writes to the console - there is no input checking

******** Feel free to use this code to get going (dont forget to attibute it to me!)
******** If you find a BUG I would like to know


File Reader Class:

## reads an external file and creates a new instance of the ClassBuilder class to interpret the new program

my_class_content:
    holds the entire text of the PlantUML class text

all_my_classes:
    holds the classes that are created in a list

my_relationship_content:
    placeholder - will hold the relationships between classes

read_file:
    reads the input file and splits into classes, classes are returned into the my_class_content list

find_classes:
    reads the my_class_content list, finds the class name, attributes and methods and builds a new class object.
    The new class is added to the all_my_classes list

add_class:
    called by the find_classes method to build the class

print_program:
    prints the program to the console (python layout) - this method needs to be amended to write to a python file

ClassBuilder Class:

## builds the class with methods and attributes

add_class_attributes:
    adds the attributes to the class (as seperate objects)
add_class_methods
    adds the methods to the class (as seperate objects)
print_class:
    prints the class to the console (python layout) - this method needs to be amended to write to a python f

class Attribute:

## holds the attribute data
str method overwritten to required format

class Method:

## holds the method data
str method overwritten to required format
